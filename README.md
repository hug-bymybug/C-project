# C-project

Iâ€™ve always believed that small projects can make a big impact. Recently, I created a console-based calculator in C. Why? Because itâ€™s a great way to hone core programming skills and dive deeper into the language!

ðŸ”§ What I learned:

Modular programming: I split the functionality into separate functions to keep the code clean and maintainable.
User Interaction: The calculator accepts user input for mathematical operations and provides feedback instantly.
Error handling: I made sure the program gracefully handles invalid inputs and division by zero. ðŸš«
âœ¨ What the calculator can do:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Exit (E)
